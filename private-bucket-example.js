// Example: How to modify the app for private bucket with signed URLs
// This would replace the public URL approach in src/app/api/upload/route.ts

// Instead of this (current approach):
// const { data: { publicUrl } } = supabase.storage
//   .from('attachments')
//   .getPublicUrl(fileName);

// You would use this for private bucket:
const { data: signedUrlData, error: signedUrlError } = await supabase.storage
  .from('attachments')
  .createSignedUrl(fileName, 3600); // 1 hour expiry

if (signedUrlError) {
  console.error('Error creating signed URL:', signedUrlError);
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Failed to create signed URL' }, { status: 500 });
}

// Then you'd also need to modify how files are displayed
// in the frontend to refresh signed URLs when they expire

// For viewing files, you'd need an API endpoint like:
// /api/files/[fileId]/signed-url that generates fresh signed URLs
